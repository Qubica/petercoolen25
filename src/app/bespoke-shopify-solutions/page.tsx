            The most memorable brands are built on experiences that resonate. I
            believe the difference is in the details. Those subtle moments that
            spark emotion and make your store feel unforgettable.
            <br />
            I&apos;m Peter, a creative developer who helps brands move beyond
            the ordinary with headless flagship stores and tailor-made
            solutions. My focus is on crafting digital journeys that feel alive,
            authentic, and unmistakably yours.

          <h2 className={styles.heading3}>Designing for connection</h2>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            True connection happens when technology and emotion work together.
            With a headless approach, your Shopify store becomes a canvas for
            meaningful interactions. Each one designed to turn your customers
            into loyal fans.

            The importance of your website in the age of AI
          </h2>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            In a world where social media and AI are always shifting, your
            website is the one place you truly own. It’s where your story, your
            values, and your vision come together without compromise. Social
            channels are great for discovery, but your site is where curiosity
            turns into connection, and connection turns into loyalty. That’s why
            I believe investing in your own digital home is more important than
            ever.

            When does going custom make sense?
          </h2>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Building or rebuilding a custom storefront is a big decision. It is
            not always the answer to every challenge, but when the time is
            right, it unlocks real advantages. A custom build gives you full
            control over your brand experience, performance, and future growth.
            You are no longer limited by Shopify&apos;s constraints.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.heading3}>When is it the right move?</h3>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            When your current setup is holding you back. Maybe you cannot launch
            new features, expand internationally, or personalize the experience
            for your customers. A custom storefront can be the key to unlocking
            your next stage of growth. It is also the right call when technical
            limitations are hurting conversions, or when maintaining your old
            system takes more energy than building something new. When your site
            is stitched together with workarounds and you are spending more time
            fixing than improving. Then it is time to consider a custom
            solution.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.heading3}>When should you wait?</h3>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Not every problem needs a full rebuild. If your conversion rate is
            flat, start by testing and optimizing. If your site just looks
            outdated, a design refresh can go a long way. And do not get
            distracted by what competitors are doing or by the latest technology
            trends. The best reason to go custom is when it directly supports
            your business goals and delivers a clear return on investment.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            The smartest strategy is to get clear on what your business really
            needs. If you want to talk through your options and figure out the
            best move forward,{" "}
